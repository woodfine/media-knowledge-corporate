Woodfine [[topic-direct-hold-framework|Direct-Hold]] assets carry no redemption queue — each investor's equity corresponds to a specific property, and liquidity depends on the private market for that asset, not on the corporate entity's cash reserves. Because no commingled pool exists, the condition that makes redemption mechanisms necessary is absent by design. Liquidity executes through the [[topic-equity-transfer-model|Equity Transfer Model]], and asset-level debt is constrained by the [[topic-interest-coverage-ratio|Interest Coverage Ratio]] so that cash reserves are not required to service obligations.

## Key takeaways

- The Direct-Hold architecture eliminates the pooled-capital condition that makes redemption queues necessary; no commingled fund means no queue to manage or suspend.
- Investors exit through a private-market sale of their specific asset interest, leaving all other investors' positions unaffected.
- Without a redemption queue, the coordination failure that produces artificial bank runs in pooled vehicles cannot arise.

## Why redemption queues exist

In a pooled fund, a redemption queue manages the tension between investor liquidity requests and the illiquid nature of physical real estate. The fund holds a cash reserve to honor near-term redemptions. If redemption requests exceed the reserve, the queue activates — investors wait while the fund sells assets or raises fresh capital.

The cash reserve is a structural liability. It earns less than the underlying assets. It must be maintained even when no redemptions are pending. Its size is a judgment call subject to manager discretion.

## What the Direct-Hold architecture removes

The Direct-Hold architecture removes the condition that requires a cash reserve. There is no pooled capital. Each investor's equity corresponds to a specific property, not to a share in a pool. The corporate entity does not promise to return capital on demand — because there is no pool to draw from.

An investor who wants to exit locates a willing buyer in the private market. The investor receives the proceeds of that private sale. The corporate entity updates the [[topic-property-ledger-technology|ledger]]. No cash reserve is tapped. No other investor's position is affected.

## Artificial bank runs

A redemption queue is vulnerable to a coordination failure: if investors anticipate that the queue will be suspended, early redemption requests can trigger the very suspension they feared. This is a structural instability in pooled vehicles.

The Direct-Hold architecture is immune to this failure mode. There is no queue to join, no suspension to anticipate, and no first-mover advantage to coordinating an early exit. An investor's equity is determined by the private market for that specific asset — not by the behavior of other investors in a shared pool.

## Investor implications

The structural consequence for investors is explicit: Woodfine Management Corp. does not provide a redemption facility. Liquidity depends on the private market for the specific asset. The Direct-Hold structure carries a different risk profile than a pooled fund — the corporate entity makes no liquidity commitment it cannot fulfill, because no pooled capital exists from which such a commitment could be honored.

Without a redemption queue, no coordinated exit pressure can destabilize the portfolio. Long-term equity compounds without the structural drag of a cash reserve that earns less than the underlying assets, consistent with the [[topic-perpetual-equity-model|perpetual equity model]] applied to fractional investor holdings.

## The bottom line

The Direct-Hold architecture structurally eliminates the need for a redemption facility rather than managing one. Each investor holds a defined interest in a specific property; liquidity is determined by the private market for that asset. The corporate entity makes no liquidity commitment it cannot honor, because no pooled capital exists from which such a commitment would be drawn. Long-term equity compounds without the drag of a standing cash reserve, and coordinated exit pressure cannot destabilize the portfolio.
