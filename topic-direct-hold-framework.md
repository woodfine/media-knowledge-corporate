The Direct-Hold framework is a legal ownership structure under which each investor holds equity units in a single named direct-hold vehicle rather than a proportional claim on a commingled pool. Each direct-hold structure is constituted as an independent legal and financial unit, so a financial event affecting one cannot propagate to an investor's equity position in another. This article describes the framework's legal structure, the isolation mechanism, [[topic-equity-transfer-model|transfer and liquidity terms]] between investors, the [[topic-fiduciary-data-mandate|fiduciary data obligations]] that protect ledger integrity, and the [[topic-interest-coverage-ratio|interest coverage discipline]] applied per structure.

The framework issues structure-specific equity: each investor holds equity units in a single named direct-hold vehicle, not a share in a commingled fund.

Each asset is its own legal and financial unit, isolated as an independent vehicle. A financial event affecting one asset cannot propagate to an investor's equity in another; the isolation is a property of the architecture, not a contractual promise.

## Key takeaways

- Each investor holds equity units in a single named direct-hold vehicle rather than a proportional claim on a commingled pool.
- Because each asset is constituted as an independent legal and financial unit, a financial event affecting one asset cannot propagate to an investor's equity in another.
- Equity transfers execute directly between private parties, so there is no redemption queue and no asset is sold under pressure to fund another investor's exit.

## What it replaces

A traditional commercial real-estate fund operates on commingled capital. The fund holds many properties; an investor's share entitles them to a proportional claim on the pool, not on any specific asset. The pool manager determines distributions, liquidity windows, and when assets are sold; the investor cannot consent to or dissent from any individual asset decision. The Direct-Hold framework inverts this arrangement: investor exposure attaches to the specific asset rather than to a pooled vehicle.

The Direct-Hold framework removes the pool. Each property is its own legal and financial unit. Investors hold equity units in a vehicle constituted around a single named property, with no co-mingling with other properties and no fund-manager discretion over their capital.

## Legal isolation

Strict legal separation is structural. Each asset ledger is isolated as an independent vehicle, so a financial event affecting one asset — vacancy, litigation, refinancing — cannot propagate to the investor's equity in a different asset. Legal title to each property is held by a separate WCP Titleco nominee company that is beneficially owned by the applicable direct-hold vehicle, ring-fencing the property from obligations of any other entity in the structure.

The isolation is a property of the architecture rather than of a contractual promise. An investor evaluating one asset's risk does not have to model the rest of a portfolio.

## Transfer and liquidity

Equity transfers in the Direct-Hold model execute between private parties. There is no [[topic-redemption-elimination|redemption queue]], no liquidity window managed by the corporate entity, and no pooled cash reserve held to satisfy redemption requests.

An investor who wishes to exit locates a willing counterparty directly; the enterprise does not intermediate the process. The structure carries no pooled redemption obligation, so no asset is sold under pressure to fund another investor's exit.

## Governance

In each direct-hold vehicle, the general partner holds management authority over the vehicle and its single named property. Investor governance rights — as limited partners or equivalent unit holders — apply at the asset level rather than across a pooled portfolio: decisions pertain to the specific property in the vehicle, not to a collection of assets managed at the fund level. The [[topic-perpetual-equity-model|perpetual equity model]] applies these mechanisms to [[topic-investment-units|investment units]] held without a fixed redemption horizon.

## The bottom line

The Direct-Hold framework replaces the commingled fund with asset-specific equity: each investor holds units in a vehicle constituted around a single named property, with legal title held by a separate WCP Titleco nominee company, rather than participating in a pooled vehicle. Because every asset is its own legal and financial unit, isolation is a property of the architecture and cross-asset contagion cannot occur, so an investor evaluating one asset's risk need not model the rest of a portfolio. With transfers executing directly between private parties, the structure carries no pooled redemption obligation and no fund-manager discretion over an investor's capital.
