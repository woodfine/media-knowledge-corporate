Woodfine [[topic-direct-hold-framework|Direct-Hold]] equity transfers freely between private parties; the corporate entity records the change but does not approve or intermediate it. Two structural principles govern the model: freely transferable equity and strict peer-to-peer execution — no corporate intermediation, no liquidity windows. The model relies on the [[topic-fiduciary-data-mandate|fiduciary data mandate]] for ledger integrity and operates alongside the [[topic-interest-coverage-ratio|interest coverage ratio]] discipline applied at the asset level.

## Key takeaways

- Direct-Hold equity is freely transferable to any willing counterparty without requiring corporate approval for the transfer — distinguishing the model from restricted-equity structures where the issuer holds right of first refusal or imposes transfer conditions.
- The corporate entity does not maintain a secondary market, matched-order book, or buyback facility; liquidity is determined by the market of willing buyers, not by corporate policy.
- Each transfer is recorded on the asset ledger with a full chain of title, so ownership of a fractional interest is always evidenced by a ledger entry rather than a paper certificate.

## Freely transferable equity

Woodfine Management Corp. issues freely transferable private equity in each isolated [[topic-property-ledger-technology|property ledger]]. "Freely transferable" means the holder may offer their interest to any willing counterparty without requiring corporate approval for the transfer itself. The corporate entity maintains the ledger but does not control who may acquire equity in it. Each unit of equity issued constitutes an [[topic-investment-units|investment unit]] in the named asset.

This distinguishes the model from restricted-equity structures — common in private real estate vehicles — where the issuer retains right of first refusal, imposes transfer restrictions, or requires investor qualification re-approval on each transfer.

## Peer-to-peer execution

Transfer execution is strictly between private parties. The corporate entity does not maintain a secondary market, a matched-order book, or a buyback facility. An investor seeking liquidity locates a willing counterparty through their own commercial relationships or through broker-dealer channels that operate independently of the corporate entity.

## No subjective liquidity requirements

Traditional fund structures impose redemption gates, liquidity reserves, and lock-up periods subject to fund manager discretion. The Equity Transfer Model contains none of these mechanisms — see [[topic-redemption-elimination|Redemption Elimination]] for the structural rationale. Liquidity terms are determined by the market of willing buyers, not by corporate entity policy. The [[topic-perpetual-equity-model|perpetual equity model]] applies the same logic over an indefinite holding horizon.

## Ledger integrity

The asset ledger records each transfer with a full chain of title. Ownership of a fractional interest is a ledger entry, not a paper certificate. The mathematical integrity of the ledger is maintained by the corporate entity's fiduciary data systems — described further in [[topic-fiduciary-data-mandate|Fiduciary Data Mandate]].

## The bottom line

The Equity Transfer Model removes the corporate entity from the liquidity equation without removing it from the record-keeping obligation. Investors can transfer their position to a willing counterparty at any time; WMC's role is to record that transfer accurately, not to approve it or to provide a market for it. The absence of redemption gates and liquidity windows is a design feature, not a limitation: it eliminates the structural tension between asset liquidity and investor liquidity that characterizes pooled fund structures. The ledger — maintained under the fiduciary data mandate — provides the authoritative record of every transfer in the chain of title.
