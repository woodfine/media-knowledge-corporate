An investor in a WMC [[topic-direct-hold-framework|Direct-Hold]] asset holds a position in a specific named property. Access to position data, financial reports, and transaction records is provided through the investor portal operated by Woodfine Management Corp. The portal reflects the investor's [[topic-property-ledger-technology|ledger]] position — equity percentage, financial event history, and transfer records — for each asset in which they hold a position. The position is structured as a fractional [[topic-investment-units|investment unit]] in the named asset.

## Key takeaways

- Position data, financial reports, and transfer records are presented per asset — the portal does not aggregate across multiple Direct-Hold positions, because each asset is its own distinct financial and legal unit.
- Financial disclosures triggering material change reporting under NI 51-102 are filed on SEDAR+ as well as through the investor portal, satisfying continuous-disclosure obligations.
- WMC controls portal access provisioning and revocation; PointSav maintains the portal infrastructure — the division of responsibility matches the broader vendor-customer model.

## Position data

Position data represents the investor's current fractional equity in the named asset: the percentage held, the date of acquisition, the acquisition cost recorded on the ledger, and the cumulative financial event history since acquisition. Position data is specific to the asset — it does not aggregate across multiple Direct-Hold positions. Each asset is its own financial and legal unit.

## Financial reports

WMC provides investors with periodic financial reports for each asset in which they hold a position. Reports cover asset-level performance: occupancy rate, rental income, debt service, distributions, and net operating income. Reports do not aggregate across assets; each report corresponds to a single asset and a single investor's position in that asset.

The frequency and format of financial reports is governed by WMC's investor communications standards, consistent with the [[topic-continuous-disclosure|disclosure obligations]] applicable under NI 51-102. Where financial events trigger material change reporting, that disclosure occurs through SEDAR+ as well as through the portal.

## Transfer records

When an investor transfers equity to a counterparty under the [[topic-equity-transfer-model|Equity Transfer Model]], the ledger records the transaction: timestamp, transferring party identity, acquiring party identity, and the percentage transferred. The transferring investor receives confirmation of the completed transaction. The acquiring investor receives an updated position statement reflecting the new equity percentage.

WMC updates the ledger to reflect the transfer. WMC does not approve or broker transfers between private parties — its role is to record the transaction accurately on the ledger and confirm the updated positions to both parties.

## No secondary market

WMC does not operate a secondary market, a matched-order book, or a buyback facility — see [[topic-redemption-elimination|Redemption Elimination]] for the structural rationale. Investors seeking liquidity identify a willing counterparty independently. The corporate entity does not intermediate this process and makes no representation about the availability or pricing of private liquidity for any specific asset.

Broker-dealer channels that operate independently of the corporate entity may be engaged by investors to arrange transfers; WMC makes no representation about the suitability, availability, or cost of such channels.

## Portal access

Portal access is credential-based. WMC is responsible for investor authentication and for provisioning and revoking portal access. PointSav maintains the portal infrastructure; WMC controls who is provisioned access and under what conditions. Credentials are issued at the time an investor completes the onboarding process for a specific asset.

## The bottom line

The investor portal provides a ledger-accurate view of each investor's position in each named asset — not a summary portfolio view. Reports, transfer confirmations, and position statements are all asset-specific, reflecting the Direct-Hold structure in which each property is a discrete legal and financial unit. WMC does not broker liquidity or operate a secondary market; its portal role is to provide accurate, timely access to the records that define the investor's position and to record transfers when they occur. The portal is a read-and-record interface, not a trading venue.
